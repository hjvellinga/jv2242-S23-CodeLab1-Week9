# An ode to Coen

Slide the bars to pick a Burn After Reading Character. 
Made a dictionary with a string key and Sprite value; for the string I made an index called "heaviestattribute" which is different per slider (entered the strings manually in the Unity inspector); the different Sprite components I added manually to the DictionaryScript component attached to the DictionaryScripGameObject.
